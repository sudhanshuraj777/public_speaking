        <h2>Overcoming Stage Fright        </h2>
        <h3>Why Do We Feel Nervous?        </h3>
        <p>Stage fright, or glossophobia, happens because our brain perceives public speaking as a threat. The body's fight-or-flight response kicks in, causing sweating, shaky hands, and a racing heart.        </p>
        <h3>Techniques to Reduce Anxiety:
        </h3>
        
            <p><b>Deep Breathing:</b> Try the 4-7-8 technique—inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7, exhale for 8.</p>
            <p><b>Visualization:</b> Imagine yourself giving a successful speech.</p>
            <p><b>Practice & Preparation:</b> The more you rehearse, the more confident you all feel.</p>
            <p><b>Positive Self-Talk:</b> Replace “I will mess up” with “I am prepared and ready.”</p>
            <p><b>Start Small:</b> Practice in front of a mirror, then with friends, then a small audience.</p>

        <h3>Why Body Language Matters: </h3>
        <h4>

        <h3>Why Vocal Variety Matters: </h3>
        <h4>
